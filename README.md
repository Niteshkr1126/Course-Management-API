# Course-Management-API
Course Management API with Derby database using Spring Boot Framework.

Developed a standalone end-to-end Course management spring application having complete database backed REST API using Spring Boot.

Created some RESTful endpoints for course management system by developing business controllers, services and repository classes using spring boot.

Topic and Course are two models or database entities used in the project. A topic can have multiple courses, hence maintained the foreign-key relationship between the entities using JPA.

Apache Derby has been used as database and Spring Data JPA has been used for data layer. 

This app supports all CRUD operations for topic and course entities.
